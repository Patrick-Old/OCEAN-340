# OCEAN-340
Course material I created, instructed, and graded at the University of Washington in Winter 2019. The course is designed to equip students with the skills needed to conduct sophisticated oceanographic research using Python.

Students entered the course with a foundation in programming in Python. In general, it was clear students understood how to use variables, loops (though not necessarily whether to use indexed loops versus for each loops), 1-D arrays, plotting points on a map and line plots, read in data from csv files, and a few other basics of programming.

Students learned how to use dictionaries, while loops, read and write data from various file types relevant to oceanography (CSV, CNV, netCDF), work with multi-dimensional arrays (up to four dimensions), create contour plots on maps and cross sections, and began to work with xarray and pandas dataframes. 

In the future, example student projects will be posted here: 

The course syllabus and assignments are posted to this page. 

A few example assignment outputs will be found below in the future (TODO)



I also worked with the chair of the Informatics program at the University of Washington, Andy Ko, to study my teacher identity development throughout this entire process, as I taught this course grounded in data science while also learning how to teach.
